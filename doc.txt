Bugs Documentation:

1.- (Line 309) - Severe Fault: Variable Project was undeclared.
2.- (Line 367) - Severe Fault: Deleted internal while(!checkers) loop since it would throw the program into infinite execution.
3.- (Line 362) - Moderate Fault: Choice doesn't have to be initialized to zero.
4.- (Line 362) - Severe Fault: Choice was changed to char from int to avoid issues when entering a nonnumerical value.
5.- (Line 296) - Moderate Fault: i declared in loop as unsigned int and that would always evaluate to false when i < 0.
6.- (Line 365) - Cosmetic Fault: Switched while(1) to while(true) for cleaner and more general implementation.
7.- (Line 364) - Moderate Fault: Deleted variable checkers which is not needed anymore since its loop was deleted.
8.- (Line 402) - Cosmetic Fault: Added an error message printing when the default case of the switch statement is reached.
9.- (Lines 380, 384, 387, 390, 393, 396, 399) - Severe Fault: Switched the cases from integer to characters to match the declaration of choice.
10.- (Line 186) - Severe Fault: sel changed from int to char to avoid infinite loop when entering non-int value.
11.- (Line 195) - Severe Fault: Changed integer values in the if statement to their respective character values.
12.- (Lines 201, 209, 218, 226) - Severe Fault: Switched the cases from integer to characters to match the declaration of choice.
13.- (Lines 141, 142, 143, 144) - Logical error: input for U-Number saved to email variable and vice versa before creating student
