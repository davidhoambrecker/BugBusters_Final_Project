Bugs Documentation:

1.- (Line 309) - Severe Fault: Variable Project was undeclared.
2.- (Line 367) - Severe Fault: Deleted internal while(!checkers) loop since it would throw the program into infinite execution.
3.- (Line 362) - Moderate Fault: Choice doesn't have to be initialized to zero.
4.- (Line 362) - Severe Fault: Choice was changed to char from int to avoid issues when entering a nonnumerical value.
5.- (Line 296) - Moderate Fault: i declared in loop as unsigned int and that would always evaluate to false when i < 0.
6.- (Line 365) - Cosmetic Fault: Switched while(1) to while(true) for cleaner and more general implementation.
7.- (Line 364) - Moderate Fault: Deleted variable checkers which is not needed anymore since its loop was deleted.
8.- (Line 402) - Cosmetic Fault: Added an error message printing when the default case of the switch statement is reached.
9.- (Lines 380, 384, 387, 390, 393, 396, 399) - Severe Fault: Switched the cases from integer to characters to match the declaration of choice.
10.- (Line 186) - Severe Fault: sel changed from int to char to avoid infinite loop when entering non-int value.
11.- (Line 195) - Severe Fault: Changed integer values in the if statement to their respective character values.
12.- (Lines 201, 209, 218, 226) - Severe Fault: Switched the cases from integer to characters to match the declaration of choice.
13.- (Lines 141, 142, 143, 144) - Severe Fault: Logical error, input for U-Number saved to email variable and vice versa before creating student.
14.- (Lines 289 - 294): Severe Fault: Infinite for loop in save function - declaration has decrement i-- yet end of block has increment i++.
15.- (Lines 71, 76) - Severe Fault: Switched paper and project initializing values since they were swapped.
16.- (Line 85) - Moderate Fault: Changed initializiation of i and limit of the for loop.
17.- (Line 95) - Severe Fault: Changed the type of grade from char to int to match the parameter used in set functions.
18.- (Line 109, 169) - Severe Fault: Changed assignment of boolean flag from false to true.
19.- (Line 172) - Severe Fault: Deleted removal of the student from the database when the answer to confirmation is "n".
20.- (Line 213) - Severe Fault: Delete i-- from the statement to avoid infinite iteration.
21.- (Lines 236 - 238) - Cosmetic Fault: Changed structure of the for loop and information to be printed to match request.
22.- (Line 254) - Moderate Fault: Changed "<" by ">" inside of the if statement to perform correct check.
23.- (Line 264) - Severe Fault: Changed cout to cin since information must be read from the user instead of outputted.
24.- (Line 269) - Severe Fault: Assigned false to boolean flag before entering a new while loop.
25.- (Line 297) - Severe Fault: Swapped values for initialization of i and bound of the for loop.
26.- (Line 319) - Severe Fault: Changed file pointer object from write mode to read mode and corrected the NULL check.
27.- (Lines 343, 346) - Cosmetic Fault: Changed values of the grades to match those described in the guidelines.
28.- (Line 352) - Severe Fault: Changed equality operator to inequality operator to perform the appropiate check.
29.- (Lines 247 - 297) - Severe Fault: Changed input variables from ints to char, and convert chars to int where necessary to perform input checking and prevent infinite loop when a non integer is entered
